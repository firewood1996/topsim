Telescope OPerations Simulator (TopSim) is a simulation framework built to evaluate
planning and scheduling paradigms for large-scale telescope operations, such as the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA). 


Overview
--------
TopSim runs as a discreet-event simulation, in which various various Actors involved in Telescope Operations
are activated due to events that occur during an 'Observation'.

TopSim, in addition to the **SimPy** library, makes use of the following Python libraries:

* **numpy**
* **pandas** 
* **matplotlib** 

If you are using Anaconda, or have done any scientific-based programming before, it is likely you already
have these libraries installed on your machine.
