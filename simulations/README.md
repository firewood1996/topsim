# Simulations

This file contains the runner-scripts for different simulations, along with the data files they use, and the generative scripts that are used to create those files.
 
 
 This is done in the spirit (and neccessity) of reproducibility; ideally, one should be able to generate the data files used to run the simulation, in addition to running the actual simulations. This should allow for multiple cross-checking, as if the data files generated do not produce the same results, then there is an issue in the simulation and our own simulation pipeline is not correct.
