Telescope Operations Simulator (TopSim) is a SimPy-based telescope observation and data post-processing simulator, based on a fork of Robert Lexis' CloudSimPy. The intention of TopSim is to provide an end-to-end view of telescope observations, data-archival, and the subsequent processing of observation data products, with a focus on the mid-term timeline commonly used in telescope semester plans. The main intention of the simulator is to test new workflow planning and scheduling techniques designed for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its precursor telescope, the Australian Square Kilomere Array Pathfinder  (ASKAP).
